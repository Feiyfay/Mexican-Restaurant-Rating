restaurant, their cuisines, information about their consumers and the preferences of the consumers. An analysis has been done to draw out meaningful insight from this dataset which
would aid business entrepreneurs and investors in making more informed decisions.

## Problem Statement:
1. What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on
ratings?
2. What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?
